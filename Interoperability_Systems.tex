\section{Introduction}
Introduction will introduce what Interop is, what it means to be interoperable, and
why it is important to people.

\section{Interoperability}\label{difficulties}
\mycomment{this section needs a better name}


\subsection*{Requirements for Interop}
In order for interop to be a viable option, the languages in question must have some common ground. At at basic level
this means they should be able to act on similar data types and have access to the same types of files. However, simply dealing with data of the same type does not guarantee successful data sharing, as languages may deal with similar data differently. Ide and Pustejovsky \cite{Ide:2010} suggest a method for dealing with potential type conflicts through the use of metadata. Metadata can describe the type and classification of data in more broadly applicable and translatable fashion.

Of importance, particularly to metadata, but also generally regarding communication protocols, is standardization. 

\subsection*{Difficulties in achieving and maintaining Interop}



\section{Virtual Machine Systems}\label{VM}
Here, I will detail how VMs handle the issue of multiple programming languages.
From my current understanding, this is mainly done through a shared low-level language, such as Java's bytecode, or the .NET Common Intermediate Language.

\subsection*{Single Platform Language Interoperability}
Use of a virtual machine as a interoperability platform only makes sense if the system is meant to run on a single machine.

\subsection*{Platform Portability}


\section{Markup Language Solutions}\label{ML}
This section will be about Markup Languages, and what they contribute to the discussion of interoperability.
I'll discuss Starlink, which relies on markup languages at its core for the purpose of multi-system interoperability, and FML, a markup language designed to free the design of fuzzy controlers from system and hardware constraints.

\subsection*{Distributed Connectivity}
Markup languages. Yes.
