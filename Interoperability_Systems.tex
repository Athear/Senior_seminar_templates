\section{Introduction}
Introduction will introduce what Interop is, what it means to be interoperable, and
why it is important to people.

\section{Interoperability}\label{difficulties}
\mycomment{this section needs a better name}


\subsection*{Requirements for Interop}
In order for interop to be a viable option, the languages in question must have some common ground. At at basic level
this means they should be able to act on similar data types and have access to the same types of files. However, simply dealing with data of the same type does not guarantee successful data sharing, as languages may deal with similar data differently. Ide and Pustejovsky \cite{Ide:2010} suggest a method for dealing with potential type conflicts through the use of metadata. Metadata can describe the type and classification of data in more broadly applicable and translatable fashion.

Of importance in every level of the transaction is standardization. Metadata, as mentioned, can be a useful tool for data interoperability. In order to actually use it, however, both languages or programs must agree on what tags will represent what data. Standardized metadata sets ensure that programs not built with each other in mind can still interoperate without being fully redesigned. There are several catalogs attempting to form full metadata tag sets, such as the Open Archives Initiative (OAI), the ELRA Universal Catalog, and the NICT Shachi catalog.\cite{Ide:2010}

\subsection*{Difficulties in achieving Interop}
Despite tools available to promote interoperability, there are still difficulties inherent to building an interoperative system. Metadata tags can be a powerful too, but there are some subtleties about languages that should be taken into account.

One of these is the type systems of the languages in question. For instance, converting between the weakly-typed language Groovy and the strongly-type Java might require that all of the Groovy data be labeled, or it's arrays be of only a single type, effectively forcing Groovy into a strong type system. \mycomment{This requires some better introduction. also, look up how groovy does manage its Java interop}

Another area of concern is adherence to standardization.
As evidenced above, there exist a wide array of possible standards to use. Conformance to one standard does not guarantee connectivity with a system using a different standard, reducing the usefulness of such standards by the number of them in existence.\cite{?}



\section{Virtual Machine Systems}\label{VM}
Here, I will detail how VMs handle the issue of multiple programming languages.
From my current understanding, this is mainly done through a shared low-level language, such as Java's bytecode, or the .NET Common Intermediate Language.

\subsection*{Single Platform Language Interoperability}
Virtual machines can be used as a language interoperability platform when the system in question is meant to be run on a single machine. 

\subsection*{Platform Portability}


\section{Markup Language Solutions}\label{ML}



\subsection*{Distributed Connectivity}
Markup languages are primarily useful when dealing with systems that span multiple servers or platforms. 

%%TODO: discuss Starlink and its use of MDL to enhance multi-system interoperability

\subsection*{FML and Hardware Independence}
%%here, discuss FML and its purpose of freeing the design of fuzzy controllers from system and hardware constraints
