\section{Introduction}

This paper will discuss interoperability of programming languages. I'll be discussing why interoperability is desirable, followed by what challenges are presented in achieving interop.
I'll discuss two particular approaches to interoperability in markup languages(MLs) and virtual machines (VMs), with focus on one or two particular examples (CLR/.NET for VMs and Starlink or FML for MLs).


The introduction will primarily introduce what interoperability is and what it means for languages to be interoperable \cite{Ide:2010}

\section{Interoperability}\label{Interop}
This section will discuss why interoperability is important or desirable.
\begin{itemize}
	\item problem domain: languages have libraries and capabilities build for specific problems. This gives them strength in that area (such as SQL database queries?), but often they have weaknesses in other areas (such as Erlang's strings).
	\item level(?): some languages have finer-grained control over storage (like the C family), while others deal with more abstract and generalize-able data structures (like... java or ruby).
	\item hardware independence: while interoperability doesn't require this, they frequently go hand in hand. An Interop standard between two languages also means the two languages can run on different hardware without the standard caring.
\end{itemize}


\section{Virtual Machines}\label{VM}
This section will be a short background on virtual machine environments. This should cover what a virtual machine is (briefly), and the sort of things VM environments add to programming languages. Examples may include JIT compilers, memory management...

\section{Markup Languages}\label{ML}
This section will have an introduction to markup languages. I don't expect this section to be very long. Perhaps this and VM should be subsections under a "systems" section?

\section{Difficulties and Approaches}\label{approaches}
Here I will discuss specific issues encountered in achieving interoperability, and how VMs and MLs approach each of them.
