% This is a sample document using the University of Minnesota, Morris, Computer Science
% Senior Seminar modification of the ACM sig-alternate style to generate a simple annotated
% bibliography. The idea is that this document is fairly short, consisting of a brief description
% of your sources and how you intend to use them (or not). Most of the ``content'' of the
% generated document comes from the bibliography file, including the notes field which will
% provide the annotations.

\section{On Interop: Focus and Goals}
This paper will discuss interoperability of programming languages, why it may be important or required, and the difficulty involved\cite{Shetty:2009,Chisnall:2013}

I'll look at some general ideas of what it means to be interoperable and how to accomplish that.\cite{ide:2010, Osera:2012}

I will also look at two particular methods for achieving interoperability: Virtual machines and markup languages. Each of these will have a particular example associated with it.
\begin{itemize}
\item Virtual machines will have .NET or the JVM \cite{Li:2013,Hamilton:2003}
\item Markup languages will have the the Starlink system \cite{Bromberk:2011} and potentially FML \cite{Acampora:2013}
\end{itemize}

I have a few papers with uncertain utility\cite{Kats:2010,Matthews:2009, Chen:2010}, but they may still be useful.
Apart from these, I will likely be adding some Wikipedia sources for certain background knowledge (in the areas of virtual machines and markup languages).

% The following two commands are all you need to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
% annotated_bibliography.bib is the name of the BibTex file containing 
% all the bibliography entries for this example. Note that you *don't* include the .bib ending
% in the \bibliography command.
\bibliography{bibliography}  

% You must have a ".bib" file and remember to run:
%     pdflatex bibtex pdflatex pdflatex
% in order to see all the citation references correctly.
